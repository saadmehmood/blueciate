              <h3>The Way We Use Information:</h3>
              <p>
                We use the information you provide us when placing an order only to complete that
                order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent
                necessary to complete that order.<br/>
                <br/>

                We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
                not used for any other purpose and
                are not shared with outside parties.<br/>
                <br/>

                You can register with our website if you would like to receive information about
                our new services. Information you submit
                on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration
                form.<br/>
                <br/>

                We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and
                potentially share with 3rd parties.
                For example, we may tell a 3rd party that X number of individuals visited a certain
                area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
                registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
                those individuals.<br/>
                <br/>

                Finally, we never use or share the private information provided to us online in
                ways unrelated to the ones described
                above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit
                such unrelated uses.
